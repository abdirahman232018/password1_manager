Password Manager
Password Manager is a simple password management program with a user interface. It allows users to securely store and retrieve passwords by encrypting them using the Fernet encryption algorithm.

Features
User-friendly GUI for easy interaction.
Passwords are encrypted using a unique encryption key.
Encrypted passwords are saved in a text file for future retrieval.
Supports storing and retrieving passwords for different usernames.
Requirements
Python 3.6 or above
Tkinter library (usually comes pre-installed with Python)
Cryptography library (can be installed via pip install cryptography)
Getting Started
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Install the required libraries using the command pip install cryptography.
Run the program using the command python password_manager.py.
The program will generate an encryption key file (key.key) and a password file (passwords.txt) in the same directory.
Usage
Launch the program.
Enter the username and password in the respective fields.
Click "Save Password" to encrypt and save the password.
To retrieve a password, enter the corresponding username and click "Retrieve Password".
The decrypted password will be displayed in the password field.
Note: Ensure that you keep the key.key file secure as it is required for encrypting and decrypting the passwords.

Security Considerations
It is recommended to use a strong and unique encryption key to enhance the security of the passwords.
Take necessary precautions to protect the key.key file from unauthorized access.
Be cautious while storing the password file (passwords.txt) and limit access to it.
Consider additional security measures such as password-based authentication to protect the program and files.
